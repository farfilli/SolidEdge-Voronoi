# VB.net Delaunay triangulation + Voronoi Diagram

A VB.net implementation of the [Bowyerâ€“Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm).
The result is a [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) for a set of randomly generated points.
Following the Delaunay triangulation, the dual [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) is constructed.
