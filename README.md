# SolidEdge-Voronoi
Voronoi diagram generator to Solid Edge sketch

Part of the code is adapted from https://github.com/RafaelKuebler/DelaunayVoronoi

# New release with relaxation and usage of the csDelaunay library
https://github.com/jfg8/csDelaunay

# VB.net Delaunay triangulation + Voronoi Diagram

A VB.net implementation of the [Bowyerâ€“Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm).
The result is a [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) for a set of randomly generated points.
Following the Delaunay triangulation, the dual [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) is constructed.

# Installation

The application is standalone, just unzip the archive in a folder of your choice.
You can personalize Solid Edge UI to add a button that starts the Voronoi generator application; [How to add a button in Solid Edge UI](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/question/0D54O000061xsT3SAI/how-can-i-create-a-new-button-in-solidedge-toolbar-and-run-my-vbnet-code-from-it-)

# UI description

- The first textbox beside the Point label is the number of points; if you change this value you need to re-generate the Voronoi diagram
- The second textbox is the number of relaxations to perform; if you change this value the Voronoi diagram is automatically regenerated
- Draw button is used to random choose points and generate a new Voronoi diagram
- Draw in SE button is used to transfer the current Voronoi diagram in Solid Edge active sketch
- Points, Triangulation, Circles, and Voronoi options are to choose what to draw in the application, changing them will refresh the view

# Usage

- Start the application and generate a Voronoi diagram by the button "Draw"
- Open Solid Edge and open or create an Ordered Part or an Ordered SheetMetal
- Create or edit a Sketch
- While in the sketch use the "Draw in SE" button to transfer the current Voronoi diagram to Solid Edge
